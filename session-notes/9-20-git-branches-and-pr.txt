The teams common codebase is typically kept in the "main" branch. If you work on a new feature you:

1. create a new feature branch and work on that new branch.
2. commit your work on the new branch - the main branch is not effected.
3. finish work on the new feature, test the new functionality and have other developers review your work.
4. merge your feature branch into the main branch, so all your work is included in the main branch.

Naming branches
It is good practice to use short descriptive names for your feature branches, e.g. "feature/contact-form". We recommend using hyphens as separators as they make the name more comfortable to read. If fixing a bug "fix/contact-form"
